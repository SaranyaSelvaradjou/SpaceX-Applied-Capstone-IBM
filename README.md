# Summary 
The goal of this capstone project is to predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 

# Project background and context

   SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 rocket has revolutionized the aerospace industry with its reusable first stage, which  is designed to land back on Earth. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9    launches on its website at a cost of $62 million, which is significantly lower than the prices offered by other providers. Much of the cost savings for SpaceX comes      from its ability to reuse the first stage of its rockets. We will predict the probability of successful landing for the first stage and provide valuable information      to other companies that may want to compete with SpaceX in the rocket launch market.
